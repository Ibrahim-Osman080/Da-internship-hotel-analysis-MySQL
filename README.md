# Data Cleaning in SQL
In this project, we take raw housing data and transform it in MySQL to make it more usable for analysis. The primary objective was to ensure data accuracy and consistency, which involved identifying and rectifying issues such as duplicates, missing values, and formatting errors.

Key Highlights:

Tech Stack: MySQL
Challenges: Handling inconsistent data formats and missing values.
Methodology: Employed techniques such as normalization, deduplication, and data validation to clean the dataset.
Outcome: Enhanced data usability, leading to more reliable analysis and insights.
